	<p> <font size="4"> <span style="color: white"> Peyton Williams Manning, nicknamed The Sheriff, was born on March 24, 1976. He is the son of former NFL quarterback, Archie Manning, and the brother of current NFL quarterback Eli Manning.</p>  
	<p> <font size="4"> <span style="color:white"> Peyton is a former quarterback who played college football for 4 years (1994-1997) at the University of Tennessee, where their fight song, “Rocky Top,” has been regarded as one of the greatest fight songs in all of college football. (See audio player below to listen).  While at Tennessee, Peyton accounted for over 11,000 passing yards and 89 passing touchdowns, making him Tennessee’s all-time leading passer. </p>

<p> <font size="4"> <span style="color: white"> After college, Manning played 18 seasons in the NFL with the Indianapolis Colts and the Denver Broncos. He was the #1 overall pick in the 1998 NFL draft, and he started as a rookie for the Indianapolis Colts that same year. He would go on to play 13 seasons with the Colts, winning Super Bowl XLI, before being sidelined with a severe neck injury. Jim Irsay, the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, felt it was necessary to cut ties with Manning due to concerns of future injuries. </p>

<p> <font size="4"> <span style="color: white"> The next season, former legendary quarterback, John Elway, brought Manning to Denver where he would go on to set the NFL single-season passing touchdown record (55 touchdown passes), the all-time career passing yards record, all-time career passing touchdowns record, and many others in 5 seasons. He closed his NFL career in style as he won his second Super Bowl in 2015 and announced his retirement shortly after.

<p> <font size="4"> <span style="color: white"> Manning has since enjoyed his retirement returning to his alma mater, Tennessee, to watch home games, appeared on live-game broadcasts in the booth, and he will be guest starring on hit TV show, (code for italics) Modern Family, in a few weeks. Whether Manning will return to utilize his knowledge of football as a coach of front-office personnel is still up in the air, but even if he doesn’t return to the game, his legacy will always be remembered.  </p> </span>
